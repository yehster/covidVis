   * Below are Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) definitions in use in this file,
   * which allow easily changing how counties are displayed.
   *
   *
   * For the U.S. Census county codes (FIPS codes) used in this file to identify individual counties, see this link:
   * https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/codes/files/national_county.txt
   *
   * The county codes used in this file combine the 2-digit state code, which is in the second column of the file
   * linked above, and the 3-digit county code, which is in the third column of the file linked above. Each value
   * for the &quot;id&quot; attribute for each county is in the following form: &quot;c[state_code][county-code]&quot;. For example,
   * for Loving Country in Texas, the state code is &quot;48&quot; and the county code is &quot;301&quot;, so the id name for the
   * county is &quot;c48301&quot;.
   *
   * County codes used in this file can also be found on Wikimedia Commons at this link:
   * https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Usa_counties_large.svg/county_codes
   *
   * Examples:
   *
   * To color two counties red (in this case Loving County and Dallas County in Texas) simply
   * go to the CSS insertion point and add:
   *
   * #c48301, #c48113 {fill:red}
   *
   * To color an entire state's counties (in the case New Mexico, with &quot;35&quot; being the state code) a green,
   * go to the CSS insertion point and add:
   *
   * path[id*='c35'] {fill:#34A853}
   *
